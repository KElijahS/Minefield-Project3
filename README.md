## Billboard Top 100-Project3
We chose to study the data provided in the Billboard Top 100 charts from years 1941-2020. Billboard Magazine was founded in 1864 by William H. Donaldson and James H. Hennegan. The first issue of billboard magazine was launched in 1894. As time progressed, a chart called “First Hits Chart”  was created in July of 1940. The billboard  top 100 as we know it today showed up in 1956 and eventually became digital in 1995. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90288887/149623774-4b8e2b92-3594-45b6-bb23-50afcb2e499b.png)
