## Billboard Top 100-Project3
We chose to study the data provided in the Billboard Top 100 charts from years 1941-2020. Billboard Magazine was founded in 1864 by William H. Donaldson and James H. Hennegan. The first issue of billboard magazine was launched in 1894. As time progressed, a chart called “First Hits Chart”  was created in July of 1940. The billboard  top 100 as we know it today showed up in 1956 and eventually became digital in 1995. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90288887/149623774-4b8e2b92-3594-45b6-bb23-50afcb2e499b.png)



### Starting Data Webscrape
We scraped data from the two websites http://billboardtop100of.com/ and https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end focusing on the history of the billboard Top 100 chart starting in 1941 and ending in 2020. We focused on 5 focus groups ‘Female’ , ‘Male’, ‘Male Group’, ‘Female Group’, ‘Mixed Group’. There were some years that artists did alot of collaboration and those years fell into the 'Mixed Group category'. In the 90s we noticted the rise of "Male Groups' but we noticed that 'Male artists dominated the charts throughout the years.In 2005, we saw the rise in 'Female artists' which we hope to see in the future years. Adele "Easy on me is currrently dominating the charts in the No.1 spot.

### CREATING THE DATA VISUALIZATION
We scraped the data from the website and cleaned the data using Pandas in juypter notebook.

Once the data was cleaned we began working on the HTML code to create the website.

Once the website was up and running we began plottting our charts to tell our visual story.

#### Conclusion
This data could be used for multiple reasons. As a fan of music, it was interesting to see the years that female artists did well in the charts as opposed to male artists who usually dominate the field. The charts could be used by music labels or independent artists seeing what listeners love the most to create genre of music around that will sell. In music, the data algorisms run the listener behavior. Overall, we saw the change from the early 70s into the 2000s. Male artists dominated in the 2000s and male groups dominated in the 60s. We see a rise in females in the mid 90s around 1995 females dominated the charts. Currently, Adele is on top of the charts with “Easy on me” that was just released last month.
